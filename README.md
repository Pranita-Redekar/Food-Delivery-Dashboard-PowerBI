<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

The Food Delivery Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to analyze food order transactions for a food delivery platform. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of order quantity, transaction volume, customer behavior, payment preferences, and food item performance over time. It enables stakeholders to quickly monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify trends that support data-driven business decisions.



<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Food delivery businesses deal with large volumes of transactional data but often lack a clear and quick way to extract insights from it. Decision-makers need answers to questions such as:<br>
-Which food items generate the highest demand?<br>
-How do transactions vary across months?<br>
-What payment methods are most preferred by customers?<br>
-What percentage of orders are successfully delivered versus cancelled?<br>
Without a centralized dashboard, analyzing this data becomes time-consuming and inefficient. This project solves the problem by presenting all critical insights in a single, interactive dashboard.
